# Zeplin Guide for Developers ⚗️ 📚 

##### Legend: 💡: Pro-tip

## Welcome to Zeplin
Zeplin is a designer/developer collaboration tool. Designers upload their artboards/screens via their preferred design program (Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop) into Zeplin. Team members in Zeplin can view designs, make comments, tag others, view layer data, code snippets, components, and download image assets. 

Zeplin acts as a source of truth for development to implement in a connected space, encouraging collaboration by all project stakeholders. 

>💡 Zeplin helps make your design, development, and collaboration life easier.

### Desktop vs. Web app
The Zeplin Web app has access everything you need. 
Zeplin has macOS and Windows desktop apps, however these are not _required_ unless you're:
* Importing designs into Zeplin
* Using Zeplin [Pop-out](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/comparing-appwebsite-with-designs-using-pop-out) feature to overlay the designs on your simulator

>💡Zeplin Web works on Linux


## Zeplin Projects
Zeplin projects are created by designers and are platform-specific. Each project has a dashboard of all the uploaded designs, and a Styleguide, which is a collection of the Text Styles, Colors, and Components.

|Project Type   |
| ------------- |
| iOS           | 
| Android       | 
| Web           | 
| macOS         | 

### Dashboard
Your Dashboard will display your personal, and your Organization projects (if applicable).

>💡 Dashboard  ⌨️: Command + D (Mac), ⌥ + A (Mac Web), Alt + A (Windows)

### Styleguide

Collection of the projects Colors, Text Styles, and Components. 

>💡You can change [color formats](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/changing-color-formats) to RGB, ARGB or Hex


>💡 Styleguide ️⌨️: Command + G (Mac),  ⌥ + S (Mac Web), Alt + S (Windows)

>_ex. I have personal projects, Zeplin Organization, and Game of Throne's Organization projects_


#### Components

Components are reusable elements imported from your team's preferred design tools into Zeplin. 

|  Design Tool     |    Native Component name        | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Sketch [[read more](https://support.zeplin.io/sketch-integration/exporting-components-from-sketch)]       | Symbols  | 
| Figma [[read more](https://support.zeplin.io/figma-integration/exporting-components-from-figma)]     | Components |
| XD ⚠️ [_coming soon_] | Symbols  |

When the team exports their symbols/components from their design tool into Zeplin, you'll be able to easily identify elements that are components. For any element that is a component, you can see a blue header on that element, in addition to a link to that component in the sidebar (_see image below_).

## Sharing project URIs ([read more](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/sharing-app-uris))
Links to projects in Zeplin will open in the Web or Desktop App

## Team Collaboration ([read more](https://support.zeplin.io/quick-start/collaborating-with-your-team))

### Commenting

You can quickly add a note by Cmd + Clicking (Ctrl for Windows and Linux users) anywhere on the screen. You can even mention other teammates with “@” and they will receive a notification.

If you're tagged in a  note, you can resolve that note.

![alt text](./img/monkey.png "Naming convention for image assets")
>💡Show/hide notes on a design by clicking the 🙈 icon

## Layers
Layer units are specific to the Zeplin project type (Web, iOS, Android).

|Platform        | Unit  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| iOS      | pt |
| Android      | dp     |
| Web | px |

### Measurements 
By clicking on an element you can see its size. Once clicked you can move your mouse around and see spacing it is from other elements. Additionally, on the right panel, any assets, colors, coordinates, and code markup such as CSS (ex. if Zeplin project type is Web) will be present.

![alt text](./img/measurements.png "Components in Zeplin")

>💡Hold "alt" to see relative distances instead of discrete values.

![alt text](./img/percentages.png "Components in Zeplin")

### Assets 

>💡 If you cannot download assets for a screen, remind your designers to mark those elements as exportable in their design tool. If they are marked as exported and imported into Zeplin, you'll then be able to download them! 

Like layer data, Zeplin tailors assets to the platform your project is set to. The designers on your team will need to mark the assets you need to download from Zeplin as "exportable". 

If an image is marked as exportable, Zeplin automatically provides the resources in  **1x 2x 3x densities**. ✨

|Platform        | Unit  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| iOS      | PNG / PDF |
| Android      | PNG / SVG      |
| Web | PNG / SVG |

>💡[Download ALL assets](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/downloading-all-available-assets-in-a-screen) for any screen by clicking on the "knife" icon

>💡 If you want to use your own optimization tools, SVGO optimization is configurable (on / off) in Zeplin.

![alt text](./img/namingConvention.png "Naming convention for image assets")

>💡 Asset naming convention is configurable (camelCase / snake_case / kebab-case).

![alt text](./img/namingConvention.png "Naming convention for image assets")

>💡You can rename assets, keep in mind that this will apply only locally.

## Extensions & Code Snippets
Extensions are the mechanism Zeplin uses to generate code snippets. Some are platform specific, and some are platform agnostic. 

All Zeplin extensions are JavaScript modules that generate code snippets from various design elements. All code snippets you interact with in Zeplin are generated using extensions. Developers can write their own if they wish, [read more](https://github.com/zeplin/zeplin-extension-documentation) about Zeplin extensions.

### Build your own Extension
Zeplin extension manager ([**zem**](https://github.com/zeplin/zem)), is a command line tool that lets you quickly create and test extensions.

Follow the [zem tutorial](https://github.com/zeplin/zeplin-extension-documentation/blob/master/tutorial.md#adding-a-local-extension) to start building your own Zeplin custom extension.

## Prototyping / User flow links ([read more](https://blog.zeplin.io/flows-in-zeplin-round-one-c56550f23f0f))

When you export your artboards with links to Zeplin, these links will be clickable in Zeplin as well, with no additional setup. Selecting a layer below a hotspot will inform the user and present a button on the right panel to quickly jump to the destination.

>💡 When you hold down the Shift key all the hotspots/prototyping will be revealed

## Q / A 

**Q**: Why are my specs off? 

**A:** Designer might have set the density of the project incorrectly. They can correct this setting [here](https://support.zeplin.io/zeplin-101/choosing-the-correct-project-type-and-density).
